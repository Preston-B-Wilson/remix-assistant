# Remix Assistant Pre Alpha

I hope to create a python desktop app to streamline my music remixing/publishing proccess.


## Roadmap
To kick things off I made this detailed drawing of how this is going to work.

As you can see, this should be straight forward.

At the time of writing this, I have layed the ground work for the youtube converter and have begun tinkering with kivy for my UI. 

I also finished the first draft of a figma sketch for one of the UI tabs.
